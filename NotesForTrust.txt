I am creating this document to explain what I know you will need to start it up from the beginning.

I am also assuming that an Administrator is the one that gets this project.

*** Do NOT DELETE any users as it will mess up the search page. ***

Having said that, you will need to open a terminal and type:

python3 manage.py createsuperuser

then you follow the prompt.

To create users, you can easily create them through the create user link on the home page.

After creating them, you will need to go to the admin panel, and create a profile for them. 

It's the text on the left hand side of the screen on the admin panel that says profile.

After that they can then start using it like it should be used.

*** The Default Password Is ***

 OneTwoThree

***           ***           ***

If you would like to change the default Password,

go into the views.py inside of the TrustApp folder and change the six places that 'OneTwoThree' 
are at.
